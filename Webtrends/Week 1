What CSS and Javascript frameworks are currently available?
there is a bunch.
I've heard of jquery as the most used js framework
I enjoyed using bootstrap as a css framework

Why would you use a framework? What are the benefits?
For css it becomes more drag&drop (which results in quicker turn-a-round)
For js i would probably stick with the easiest, most well-documented solution as I am not familiar with the language. If I was working with someone who had js experience I would make an effort to learn their framework and if I was reccommending someone blind I would ask someone I knew with js experience
